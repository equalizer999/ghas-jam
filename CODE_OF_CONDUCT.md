# Code of Conduct

The GitHub Advanced Security Jam workshop is intended to be a place for learning, collaboration, and knowledge sharing related to GitHub Advanced Security features. This is a welcoming environment for connecting with other participants and learning about securing repositories and organizations. By participating in this workshop, you are agreeing to the same [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) that apply to GitHub.com, as well as this workshop-specific Code of Conduct.

With this Code of Conduct, we hope to help you understand how best to collaborate during the workshop, what you can expect from facilitators, and what type of actions or content may result in temporary or permanent removal from workshop activities. We will investigate any reports and may moderate content that we determine to be in violation of either the GitHub Terms of Service or this Code of Conduct.

Workshop participants bring diverse perspectives, experiences, and skill levels with security practices, ranging from those just starting their security journey to experienced security professionals. We are committed to making this GitHub Advanced Security workshop a welcoming environment for all participants while maintaining a productive learning space.

### Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming learning environment, we as facilitators and participants pledge to make participation in the GitHub Advanced Security workshop a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, ability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Standards
Treat the GitHub Advanced Security workshop with respect. The following guidelines help maintain a productive learning environment for everyone.

#### _Best Practices for a Productive Learning Environment_
*   Be respectful and considerate.
    *   Be welcoming and open-minded. Other participants may not have the same security experience or background as you, but that doesn't mean they don't have valuable insights to contribute. We encourage you to be welcoming to those new to security practices.
    *   Respect each other. Maintain a professional learning environment. Be civil and constructive, and avoid anything that could be considered offensive, abusive, or inappropriate for a professional workshop setting.
    *   Communicate with empathy. When discussing security practices or providing feedback, remember that participants have varying experience levels. Focus on helping others learn rather than criticizing their current knowledge level.

*   Contribute to a positive learning experience.
    *   Help improve understanding. Share knowledge, ask thoughtful questions, and provide constructive feedback during exercises and discussions.
    *   Stay focused on learning objectives. Keep discussions relevant to GitHub Advanced Security features, repository security, and the workshop exercises.
    *   Share resources mindfully. When sharing links or additional resources, ensure they're relevant to GitHub Advanced Security and provide proper context.

*   Be trustworthy.
    *   Share accurate information. If you're unsure about a security practice or GitHub feature, ask for clarification rather than providing potentially incorrect guidance.
    *   Respect confidentiality. Don't share sensitive information from your own organization or repositories during workshop discussions.

#### _What is not Allowed_
*   Threats of violence. You may not threaten violence towards others or use the workshop to organize, promote, or incite acts of real-world violence or terrorism. Think carefully about the words you use, the images you post, and even the software you write, and how they may be interpreted by others. Even if you mean something as a joke, it might not be received that way. If you think that someone else might interpret the content you post as a threat, or as promoting violence or terrorism, stop. Don't post it. In extraordinary cases, we may report threats of violence to law enforcement if we think there may be a genuine risk of physical harm or a threat to public safety.
*   Hate speech and discrimination. While it is not forbidden to broach topics such as age, body size, ability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation, we do not tolerate speech that attacks a person or group of people on the basis of who they are. Just realize that talking about these or other sensitive topics can make others feel unwelcome, or perhaps even unsafe, if approached in an aggressive or insulting manner. We expect our participants to be respectful when discussing sensitive topics.
*   Bullying and harassment. We do not tolerate bullying or harassment. This means any habitual badgering or intimidation targeted at a specific person or group of people. In general, if your actions are unwanted and you continue to engage in them, there's a good chance you are headed into bullying or harassment territory.
*   Impersonation. You may not impersonate another person by copying their avatar, posting content under their email address, intentionally using a deceptively similar username or otherwise posing as someone else. Impersonation is a form of harassment.
*   Doxxing and invasion of privacy. Don't post other people's personal information, such as phone numbers, private email addresses, physical addresses, credit card numbers, Social Security/National Identity numbers, or passwords. Depending on the context, such as in the case of intimidation or harassment, we may consider other information, such as photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject's consent, to be an invasion of privacy, especially when such material presents a safety risk to the subject.
*   Inappropriate content. Don't post content that would be considered inappropriate in a professional workshop setting. If you have any questions or concerns about something you want to share, reach out to workshop facilitators beforehand.
*   Spam. Respect the workshop environment. Don't post advertisements, link to irrelevant websites, or otherwise disrupt the learning experience. This workshop is meant for participants to learn about GitHub Advanced Security, ask questions, and share knowledge - not for advertising or spam-like content. Content that we deem spammy will be removed.
*   Copyrighted or illegal content. Only post your own content or content you have the right to share. You are responsible for what you post. You may not post illegal content, including content illegal under copyright and trademark laws, links to illegal content, or methods for circumventing the law.
*   Active malware or exploits. Being part of this workshop includes not taking advantage of other participants. We do not allow anyone to use the workshop environment for exploit delivery or as attack infrastructure. Note, however, that we do not prohibit the discussion of security concepts or educational examples that help participants learn about GitHub Advanced Security features.
*   Sharing sensitive security information. Don't share actual credentials, private keys, or real vulnerability details from production systems during workshop exercises.
*   Disrupting the learning environment. Avoid behaviors that prevent others from participating effectively in workshop activities.
*   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional workshop setting.

### Enforcement
#### _What Workshop Participants Can Do_
*   If you see a problem, report it. Workshop facilitators are responsible for maintaining a positive learning environment, but participants also play a role in supporting each other's learning experience.
*   When you encounter inappropriate behavior, report it directly to the workshop facilitators rather than responding publicly.

#### Our Responsibilities
Workshop facilitators will review any reported issues and respond appropriately to maintain a productive learning environment. We'll review each situation on a case-by-case basis and respond as appropriate, using this Code of Conduct to guide our decisions.

Actions we may take in response to a report include, but are not limited to:

*   Content Removal
*   Private guidance or warning
*   Temporary removal from workshop activities
*   Permanent removal from workshop activities

### Contacting Workshop Facilitators
If you need to contact workshop facilitators privately about any concerns or questions related to the workshop environment, please reach out through the designated communication channels provided during the workshop.

Let's work together to create an environment where everyone can learn effectively about GitHub Advanced Security features and best practices.
